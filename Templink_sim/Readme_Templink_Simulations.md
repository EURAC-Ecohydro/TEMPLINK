# GEOtop simulations for TEMPLINK project

## Matsch_B2_DVM_Optim_001
- Info: starting simulation for B2 Mazia site copied from: 
https://github.com/EURAC-Ecohydro/MonaLisa/tree/master/geotop/1D/Matsch_B2_DVM_Optim_001
- Purpose: make first tests in R for Templink
- Results: 
	- Run with no errors
	- Simulated and observed SMC are quite different
	
## Templink_B2_001
- Info:  Starts from Matsch_B2_DVM_Optim_001
- Changes: 
	- Simulation period
		InitDateDDMMYYYYhhmm	=	01/11/2013 00:00
		EndDateDDMMYYYYhhmm	=	    31/10/2017 23:00
	- no more dynamic vegetation parameters
	- Input Observations meteo.txt extended 
		Several gaps in wind speed
		Missed incoming radation after January 2016
	- Validation Observations obs.txt extedned 
	- Inclueded in Obs soil temperatue
- Results: 
	- running

## Templink_B2_002
- Info:  Starts from Templink_B2_001
- Changes:
	-Select the right header for incoming radiation
	-Incoming radiation and wind speed were completed from input file of Matsch_B2_DVM_Optim_001 and met_IT-MtM data from EarthObs (FLUXDATA) 
- Results:	
	- working
	- too high GST variation
	- some gaps in observations 
	- the best observations are Ts_CI_Z5
	- Freezing influence? or because there are NAs in obs for the winter period;
	
## Templink_B2_003
- Info:  Starts from Templink_B2_002
- Changes:
	Canopy fraction = 0 (bare ground)
- Results:
	-Higher values for simulated temperature;
	-Lower statistics (r2, R2, RMSE)

## Templink_B2_004
- Info:  Starts from Templink_B2_001
- Changes:
	- Canopy fraction = 0 
	- ThermalConductivitySoilSolids =  0.5    from  thermal conductivity of the soil     1.9   W m−1 K−1
- Results:
	- Slight improvement in statistics but still worst than sim 002;

## Templink_B2_005
- Info:  Starts from Templink_B2_002
- Changes:
	- Canopy fraction = 1
	- ThermalConductivitySoilSolids =  0.5    from  thermal conductivity of the soil     1.9   W m−1 K−1
	- There were no "clouds.txt" file in the input or generated by the simulation
	- GST (Ts_CS_z5 and Ts_CI_z5) is missing during the winter from the stations;
- Results:
	- Improvements in statistics than for sim 002;
	- Still the freezing influence but because there are NAs in obs for winter;

## Templink_B2_006
- Info:  Starts from Templink_B2_005
- Changes:
	- 25 thinner soil layers
	- same parameters
	- file soil called soil_25L_0001.txt
	- removed unused parameters initpsi
	- layer 4 5 cm: 6 10 cm; 9 20 cm; 17 1 m  
	
- Results:
	- Slight improvements in statistics than for sim 005;
	- Still the freezing influence but because there are NAs in obs for winter;
	- NAs in winter only when open with "geotopbricks" but not when open directly from folder; (Solved)
	- With winter temp in obs the statistics are improving excepting the RMSE;
	- Simulation overestimates about 2 K, better fit in Autumn for monthly;
	- Daily variation (cycle) is too high about 5 K;
	- The model reads correctly the inputs, the comparison of the inputs with the simulated inputs is good;

## Templink_B2_007
- Info:  Starts from Templink_B2_006
- Changes:
	- HeaderSurfaceTemperature="SurfT" !Using as input only MODIS LST daily at 10:30AM (April-October 2014 to 2017) with only 378 values from 649;
	- Initial 01/04/2014 10:30 and end 31/10/2017 10:30;
- Results:
	- The simulated GST has no variability only a smooth variation, unrealistic;
	- Weak statistics but not the worst;

## Templink_B2_008
- Info:  Starts from Templink_B2_007
- Changes:
	- InitSoilTemp = 2.6 (changed from 4 to the value of GST at 2015-04-01 10:30AM, maybe need to change to initial soil surface temperature and change to LST value?);
- Results:
	- Similar results to Templink_B2_007;

## Templink_B2_009
- Info:  Starts from Templink_B2_008
- Changes:
	- WaterBalance	= 0 !Change from "Neumann" to "Dirichlet" as the temperature boundary condition for heat transfer and heat flux (Stephan Gruber);
	- Micromet = 0  ! Consider Micrometeorology = 0 (Stephan Gruber);
	- Replace NA with -9999 
 	- To do: We need to cancel the calculation of the surface energy budget; Is don by changing to "Dirichlet"? 
	- To do: In inps file write Surface Temperature = 1 ?;
	- To do: Need to change the time step?
	- To do: Maybe delete the first row of imput with -9999?
- Results:
	- Statistics are getting worst;

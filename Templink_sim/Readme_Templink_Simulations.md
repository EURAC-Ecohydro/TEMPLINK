# GEOtop simulations for TEMPLINK project

## Matsch_B2_DVM_Optim_001
- Info: starting simulation for B2 Mazia site copied from: 
https://github.com/EURAC-Ecohydro/MonaLisa/tree/master/geotop/1D/Matsch_B2_DVM_Optim_001
- Purpose: make first tests in R for Templink
- Results: 
	- Run with no errors
	- Simulated and observed SMC are quite different
	
## Templink_B2_001
- Info:  Starts from Matsch_B2_DVM_Optim_001
- Changes: 
	- Simulation period
		InitDateDDMMYYYYhhmm	=	01/11/2013 00:00
		EndDateDDMMYYYYhhmm	=	    31/10/2017 23:00
	- no more dynamic vegetation parameters
	- Input Observations meteo.txt extended 
		Several gaps in wind speed
		Missed incoming radation after January 2016
	- Validation Observations obs.txt extedned 
	- Inclueded in Obs soil temperatue
- Results: 
	- running

## Templink_B2_002
- Info:  Starts from Templink_B2_001
- Changes:
	-Select the right header for incoming radiation
	-Incoming radiation and wind speed were completed from input file of Matsch_B2_DVM_Optim_001 and met_IT-MtM data from EarthObs (FLUXDATA) 
- Results:	
	- working
	- too high GST variation
	- some gaps in observations 
	- the best observations are Ts_CI_Z5
	- Freezing influence? or because there are NAs in obs for the winter period;
	
## Templink_B2_003
- Info:  Starts from Templink_B2_002
- Changes:
	Canopy fraction = 0 (bare ground)
- Results:
	-Higher values for simulated temperature;
	-Lower statistics (r2, R2, RMSE)

## Templink_B2_004
- Info:  Starts from Templink_B2_001
- Changes:
	- Canopy fraction = 0 
	- ThermalConductivitySoilSolids =  0.5    from  thermal conductivity of the soil     1.9   W m−1 K−1
- Results:
	- Slight improvement in statistics but still worst than sim 002;

## Templink_B2_005
- Info:  Starts from Templink_B2_002
- Changes:
	- Canopy fraction = 1
	- ThermalConductivitySoilSolids =  0.5    from  thermal conductivity of the soil     1.9   W m−1 K−1
	- There were no "clouds.txt" file in the input or generated by the simulation
	- GST (Ts_CS_z5 and Ts_CI_z5) is missing during the winter from the stations;
- Results:
	- Improvements in statistics than for sim 002;
	- Still the freezing influence but because there are NAs in obs for winter;
